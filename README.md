# workflows

A collection of GitHub Actions workflows. These workflows are from the following repositories:
- [`neoncitylights/node`](https://github.com/neoncitylights/node)
- [`neoncitylights/jsr`](https://github.com/neoncitylights/jsr)
- [`neoncitylights/php`](https://github.com/neoncitylights/php)
- [`neoncitylights/rust`](https://github.com/neoncitylights/rust)
- [`neoncitylights/mdbook`](https://github.com/neoncitylights/mdbook)

Note at this time, that these are not necessarily reusable out-of-the-box by copy and pasting, although it should only take a few edits to make them usable for you. You will usually need to add the relevant package management metadata file (like `composer.json`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`), and add relevant scripts.
